# Code Refactoring Summary - Bow Propeller & Naming Updates

## Overview

This project has evolved from a single-purpose anchor windlass controller to a comprehensive boat control system supporting both anchor windlass and bow thruster operations. This document summarizes the refactoring and expansion efforts.

## Phase A & B: Naming Refactoring

### BoatAnchorApp → BoatBowControlApp
Renamed the main application class to reflect the expanded scope beyond anchor control alone. The new name better represents the system's dual-function design.

### WinchController → AnchorWinchController
Renamed to explicitly clarify that this class is responsible for **anchor-specific** windlass control, distinguishing it from the new `BowPropellerController` which handles the separate bow thruster subsystem.

**Files Updated (15+ total):**
- Header files: automatic_mode_controller.h, remote_control.h, services/* headers
- Implementation files: corresponding .cpp files
- Test files: Updated all test references
- Documentation: README.md, copilot-instructions.md

## Expanded Architecture

### New Bow Propeller Control System

**BowPropellerController** (`include/bow_propeller_controller.h`)
- High-level interface for bow thruster control
- Methods: `turnPort()`, `turnStarboard()`, `stop()`
- Delegates to hardware layer for actual GPIO control
- Integrates with emergency stop and SignalK services

**ESP32BowPropellerMotor** (`include/hardware/ESP32BowPropellerMotor.h`)
- GPIO hardware abstraction for bow relay control
- Pins: GPIO 4 (PORT), GPIO 5 (STARBOARD)
- Active-LOW logic for safety (relays default inactive on boot)
- Mutual exclusion: prevents simultaneous activation of both directions
- Methods: `turnPort()`, `turnStarboard()`, `stop()`, `getDirection()`, `isActive()`

### Integrated Remote Control

**RemoteControl** (Extended)
- Original buttons (GPIO 12/13): Anchor UP/DOWN
- New buttons (GPIO 15/16 - FUNC3/FUNC4): Bow PORT/STARBOARD
- Deadman switch for all buttons (automatic stop on release)
- Proper button priority: physical remote overrides SignalK

### Unified Emergency Stop

**EmergencyStopService** (Extended)
- Now controls both AnchorWinchController AND BowPropellerController
- Atomic activation: stops both systems simultaneously
- Blocks all subsequent commands until cleared
- Single point of safety control for the entire system

### SignalK Integration

**SignalKService** (Extended)
- Anchor paths: `navigation.anchor.*` (original functionality)
- Bow paths: `propulsion.bowThruster.command` and `propulsion.bowThruster.status`
- Emergency stop paths: `navigation.bow.ecu.emergencyStop*`
- Consistent safety blocking during connection loss or emergency stop
- Command validation: -1/0/1 mapping for both systems

### Consolidated Application

**BoatBowControlApp** (Renamed from BoatAnchorApp)
- Single orchestrator for all boat control systems
- Initializes: AnchorWinchController + BowPropellerMotor instances
- Coordinates: RemoteControl, EmergencyStopService, SignalKService
- Dependency order: Hardware → Controllers → Services

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Each class has one clear purpose:
- `AnchorWinchController` - Manages anchor windlass control
- `BowPropellerController` - Manages bow thruster control
- `HomeSensor` - Monitors anchor home position  
- `AutomaticModeController` - Handles anchor automatic positioning
- `RemoteControl` - Processes physical remote inputs
- `PulseCounter` - Reads pulse counts and converts to distance
- `PinConfig` - Centralizes hardware pin definitions
- `EmergencyStopService` - Unified emergency stop for all systems
- `SignalKService` - Handles SignalK communication for all systems

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
- New remote buttons can be added to `RemoteControl` without changing existing logic
- New boat systems (e.g., helm control) can be added to `BoatBowControlApp` without modifying existing systems
- Service bindings can be extended without refactoring core logic

### 3. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules (services) depend on abstractions (controller interfaces), not concrete implementations
- Callback mechanism provides loose coupling
- Hardware abstraction allows swapping implementations

### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Each class exposes only necessary public methods
- Clean, focused interfaces: `turnPort()`, `turnStarboard()`, `stop()`, etc.
- Services use only the methods they need from each controller

## Key Design Improvements

### Code Organization
- **Before**: Monolithic anchor-only system
- **After**: Modular architecture supporting multiple independent subsystems
- Clear separation of concerns: winch, thruster, remote, emergency stop, SignalK

### Reduced Coupling
- Subsystems communicate through well-defined service boundaries
- Controllers don't know about SignalK directly
- Emergency stop handled through single service, not scattered throughout code

### Hardware Abstraction
- Physical GPIO control isolated in Hardware layer classes
- Controllers work with abstract motor interfaces
- Easy to mock for testing without hardware
- Easy to swap implementations (e.g., different relay modules)

### Safety
- All relay outputs default HIGH (inactive) on startup
- Mutual exclusion enforced in motor classes (never both directions active)
- Emergency stop blocks all commands atomically
- Home sensor protection prevents over-retrieval of anchor

### Improved Testability
- 71 comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Tests cover: hardware control, controller logic, SignalK bindings, emergency stop, remote control integration
- Mock hardware layer allows testing without physical hardware
- Fast test execution (2.38 seconds for full suite)

- Flash usage: 69.9% of available space
- RAM usage: 9.4% of available space
