# Anchor Chain Counter - SignalK Usage Guide

## Overview
This ESP32-based anchor chain counter measures the deployed anchor rode length and provides automatic windlass control via SignalK.

## SignalK Paths

### Output (Device → SignalK)
- **`navigation.anchor.currentRode`** - Current anchor chain length in meters (updated every 1 second)

### Inputs (SignalK → Device)
- **`navigation.anchor.targetRode`** - Set target chain length for automatic control (float, meters)
- **`navigation.anchor.resetRode`** - Reset the counter to zero (boolean)

## Usage Examples

### Monitor Current Chain Length
The device continuously publishes the current rode length to `navigation.anchor.currentRode`. Subscribe to this path in your SignalK dashboard to monitor the chain length in real-time.

### Automatic Windlass Control

#### Deploy 15 meters of chain
```json
{
  "context": "vessels.self",
  "updates": [{
    "values": [{
      "path": "navigation.anchor.targetRode",
      "value": 15.0
    }]
  }]
}
```

The windlass will automatically deploy chain until 15 meters is reached, then stop.

#### Retrieve to 5 meters
```json
{
  "context": "vessels.self",
  "updates": [{
    "values": [{
      "path": "navigation.anchor.targetRode",
      "value": 5.0
    }]
  }]
}
```

The windlass will automatically retrieve chain until 5 meters remains, then stop.

#### Stop Windlass
```json
{
  "context": "vessels.self",
  "updates": [{
    "values": [{
      "path": "navigation.anchor.targetRode",
      "value": -1
    }]
  }]
}
```

Send a negative value to immediately stop automatic control.

### Reset Counter
```json
{
  "context": "vessels.self",
  "updates": [{
    "values": [{
      "path": "navigation.anchor.resetRode",
      "value": true
    }]
  }]
}
```

This resets the counter to zero, stops the windlass, and clears any active target.

## Manual Operation

When operating the windlass manually (using physical switches), the counter continues to measure and report the chain length accurately. The automatic control will not interfere as long as no target is set via SignalK.

**Best Practice:** Before manual operation, send a stop command (`targetRode: -1`) to ensure automatic control is disabled.

## Using with SignalK REST API

### GET Current Chain Length
```bash
curl http://your-signalk-server:3000/signalk/v1/api/vessels/self/navigation/anchor/currentRode
```

### PUT Target Chain Length (Deploy 20m)
```bash
curl -X PUT http://your-signalk-server:3000/signalk/v1/api/vessels/self/navigation/anchor/targetRode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 20.0}'
```

### PUT Stop Windlass
```bash
curl -X PUT http://your-signalk-server:3000/signalk/v1/api/vessels/self/navigation/anchor/targetRode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": -1}'
```

### PUT Reset Counter
```bash
curl -X PUT http://your-signalk-server:3000/signalk/v1/api/vessels/self/navigation/anchor/resetRode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": true}'
```

## Configuration

### Hardware Setup
- **Pulse Input:** GPIO 25 - Connect chain counter pulse sensor
- **Direction Input:** GPIO 26 - HIGH = chain out, LOW = chain in
- **Winch UP Output:** GPIO 27 - Activates windlass to retrieve chain
- **Winch DOWN Output:** GPIO 14 - Activates windlass to deploy chain

### Calibration
The meters per pulse conversion factor (default: 0.1) can be configured via the SensESP web interface at:
```
http://bow-sensors.local/
```

Navigate to the pulse counter configuration to adjust the `meters_per_pulse` value based on your windlass gypsy diameter.

## Safety Notes

1. **Always test in safe conditions** before relying on automatic control
2. **Keep manual override accessible** - the system respects manual operation
3. **Monitor the process** - automatic control stops when target is reached (±0.2m tolerance)
4. **Emergency stop** - send `targetRode: -1` to stop automatic operation immediately
5. **Reset after anchor retrieval** - reset the counter when the anchor is fully retrieved

## Troubleshooting

### Counter not incrementing
- Check pulse sensor connection on GPIO 25
- Verify direction sensor on GPIO 26 shows correct state

### Windlass not responding to automatic control
- Verify GPIO 27 (UP) and GPIO 14 (DOWN) connections
- Check that a valid target was set (`targetRode >= 0`)
- Ensure no manual control is active

### Wrong direction
- Check direction sensor polarity on GPIO 26
- Swap if needed: HIGH should = chain out, LOW = chain in
