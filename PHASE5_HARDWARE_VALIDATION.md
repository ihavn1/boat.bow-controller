- [ ] Relay outputs connected for testing (GPIO 4/5 for bow, GPIO 14/27 for anchor)

### Recommended Test Equipment Setup

**Minimum Setup (Budget ~$100-150)**:
1. **Logic Analyzer** (Saleae Clone or DreamSourceLab)
   - 24-channel @ 100MHz sampling
   - ~$30-50 on Amazon/AliExpress
   - **Why**: Captures all GPIO transitions with precise timing (down to microseconds)
   - **Use**: Verify relay activation timing, pulse counting accuracy, motor switching transitions

2. **Function Generator** (Optional but highly recommended)
   - Frequency range: 0.1 Hz - 10 MHz (adjust cap: 1-100 Hz for pulse testing)
   - ~$25-40 (basic units like KeItley or clone)
   - **Why**: Simulate chain movement at controlled speeds (e.g., 2 Hz = 20 pulses/sec)
   - **Alternative**: Use PC software like SIGGEN (free) via audio jack with circuit

3. **Multimeter** (Digital, $10-20)
   - Voltage/resistance/continuity testing
   - **Why**: Verify GPIO voltage levels (3.3V HIGH, 0V LOW), relay circuit continuity

4. **Breadboard + Jumper Wires + Button Switches** (~$15)

   - Test remote button presses without physical hardware

5. **Relay Module (Optional)** (~$10-20)
   - Opto-isolated 4-channel relay (active-LOW)
   - **Why**: Test actual relay switching under load (with dummy load resistors)

**Complete Mid-Range Setup (~$200-300)**:

## 1.1 Windows Setup for Logic Analysis

**Recommended Workflow**:

1. **Install Logic Analyzer Software** (FREE):
   - [Saleae Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/) (Windows, Mac, Linux)
   - Or [PulseView](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView) (free, open source)

2. **Connect Logic Analyzer to ESP32**:
   ```
   Logic Analyzer Channel → ESP32 GPIO (through 1kΩ resistor for protection)
   
   ANCHOR CONTROL (Channels 0-2):
   - CH0: GPIO 27 (ANCHOR_UP relay output)
   - CH1: GPIO 14 (ANCHOR_DOWN relay output)
   - CH2: GPIO 33 (HOME_SENSOR input - hall effect)
   
   BOW CONTROL (Channels 3-4):
   - CH3: GPIO 4 (BOW_PORT relay output)
   - CH4: GPIO 5 (BOW_STARBOARD relay output)
   
   REMOTE BUTTONS (Channels 5-8):
   - CH5: GPIO 12 (Anchor UP button)
   - CH6: GPIO 13 (Anchor DOWN button)
   - CH7: GPIO 15 (Bow PORT button)
   - CH8: GPIO 16 (Bow STARBOARD button)
   
   PULSE COUNTER (Channels 9-10):
   - CH9: GPIO 25 (PULSE_INPUT - chain counter)
   - CH10: GPIO 26 (DIRECTION - deploy/retrieve sense)
   
   FUTURE/SPARE (Channels 11-15):
   - CH11: GPIO 32 (spare - future sensor)
   - CH12-15: Available for expansion
   - GND: Connect to ESP32 GND (shared reference)
   ```

   **Total channels used**: 11 out of 16 (69% utilization)
   **Benefit**: Captures entire system state in single capture window

3. **Sampling Configuration**:
   - **Sample rate**: 1 MHz (captures 1µs resolution)
   - **Capture duration**: 10-30 seconds per test
   - **Protocol analyzers**: Enable SPI/I2C if testing those buses

4. **Capture Strategies with 16-Channel Analyzer**:

   **Strategy A: Complete System Snapshot** (All 11 channels)
   - Captures everything simultaneously
   - Ideal for: Identifying timing issues between anchor/bow/buttons
   - Start capture → Send command → Analyze interactions across all 11 channels
   - Example: See if remote button press causes relay to activate precisely when expected
   
   **Strategy B: Focus Capture** (Sub-groups of channels)
   - Reduce noise by capturing only relevant subsystem
   - **Anchor-only**: CH0-2, CH9-10 (motor + home + pulses)
   - **Bow-only**: CH3-4 (motor control - simplest for timing analysis)
   - **Remote input testing**: CH5-8 (button presses vs. relay response)
   
   **Strategy C: Temporal Correlation**
   - Use spare channels (CH11-15) for:
     - Serial TX monitoring (if available, optional)
     - Power rail observation (measure current via inline resistor)
     - Synchronization pulse from external source
   
   **Tips for 16-Channel Captures**:
   - Export CSV → import to Excel/spreadsheet for timeline analysis
   - Look for timing violations: 
     - Motor output should activate within 50ms of command
     - Relay switching should avoid "floating" states (no short HIGH→LOW glitch)
     - Button input to motor output latency: < 200ms (worst case SensESP event loop)
   - Use Saleae's "Timing Measurement" tool to quantify latencies

## 1.2 Pulse Counter Simulation Setup

**Hardware Option 1: Function Generator**:
```
Function Gen OUT → 1kΩ resistor → ESP32 GPIO 25 (PULSE_INPUT)
                                 → ESP32 GND
DIR control pin (GPIO 26):
  - Connect to GPIO 26 directly
  - Or use second function gen output for simultaneous direction changes
```

**Hardware Option 2: Manual Test (Breadboard)**:
```
ESP32 3.3V → Push button → GPIO 25 (through 1kΩ resistor)
GPIO 25 → 10kΩ pulldown to GND
GPIO 26 → Manual jumper (HIGH = deploy, LOW = retrieve)

Press button repeatedly to simulate pulses
Monitor via serial: "Pulse count: X, Rode: X.XXm"
```

**Hardware Option 3: Arduino Pulse Generator** (Most Flexible):
```cpp
// Upload to second Arduino to generate test pulses
#define PULSE_PIN 9
#define DIR_PIN 10

void setup() {
  pinMode(PULSE_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(DIR_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // 2 Hz pulse (0.5 sec HIGH, 0.5 sec LOW)
  digitalWrite(PULSE_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(PULSE_PIN, LOW);
  delay(500);
  
  // Change direction every 10 pulses
  digitalWrite(DIR_PIN, (millis() / 5000) % 2);
}
```

## 1.3 Remote Control Button Simulation

**Physical Button Test** (Accurate but manual):
```
GPIO 12 ← Button (active HIGH, release = LOW)
GPIO 13 ← Button
GPIO 15 ← Button
GPIO 16 ← Button

ESP32 3.3V → 10kΩ resistor → Button → GPIO
                            → 10kΩ pulldown to GND
```

**Breadboard Setup**:
- Place 4 pushbuttons on breadboard
- Wire to GPIO 12/13/15/16
- Connect to 3.3V and GND rails
- Serial monitor shows: "Remote: UP pressed", "Remote: DOWN released"

---

## 1.5 Complete 16-Channel Test Workflow

**Objective**: Use all 16 channels to capture entire system behavior in a single test sequence

**Setup** (all 11 channels connected as described in section 1.1):
```
Channels 0-10: CONNECTED (as per allocation)
Channels 11-15: SPARE/AVAILABLE
Sampling: 1 MHz, 30-second capture
```

**Test Sequence**:

### Phase A: Boot Validation (Channels 0-4)
1. **Pre-capture**: System powered off
2. **Start capture** in Saleae
3. **Power on** ESP32 via USB
4. **Expected on capture**:
   - All relay outputs (CH0-4) remain HIGH for 500ms+ (safe default)
   - No spurious LOW pulses during boot
   - Stable state within 2 seconds

**Analysis** (check for):
- ✅ All relay pins start HIGH (inactive)
- ✅ No glitches or noise on GPIO lines
- ✅ Smooth transition to stable state

---

### Phase B: Pulse Counting with Remote Button (Channels 5-10)
1. **Setup**: Function generator or Arduino pulse generator on GPIO 25 @ 2 Hz
2. **Direction**: GPIO 26 set HIGH (deploy mode)
3. **Remote button**: Connect pushbutton to GPIO 12 (Anchor UP)
4. **Start capture**
5. **Execute sequence**:
   - Wait 2 seconds (baseline)
   - Press GPIO 12 button for 1 second (simulating anchor UP command)
   - Release button
   - Function gen pulses continue for 10 seconds
   - Stop capture at 15 seconds

**Expected timing on analyzer**:
```
T=0s:   Boot complete, all relays HIGH
T=2s:   Button press: CH5 (GPIO 12) LOW
T=2.05s: Relay activation: CH0 (ANCHOR_UP) drops to LOW (< 50ms latency)
T=2.05s-3.05s: Motor active, pulses arriving on CH9
T=3.05s: Button release: CH5 (GPIO 12) HIGH
T=3.10s: Relay deactivation: CH0 (ANCHOR_UP) back to HIGH (~50ms delay)
T=3.10s+: Pulses stop correlating to motor activity
```

**Analysis** (check for):
- ✅ Button press (CH5) → Motor activation (CH0) latency < 100ms
- ✅ Motor deactivates within 100ms of button release
- ✅ Pulse counter (CH9) shows clean square wave
- ✅ Direction sense (CH10) stable throughout
- ✅ NO floating states (motor pins never both LOW simultaneously)

---

### Phase C: Bow System Testing (Channels 3-8)
1. **Setup**: Connect GPIO 15 and GPIO 16 buttons
2. **Start capture**
3. **Execute sequence**:
   - T=0s: Press GPIO 15 (BOW_PORT)
   - T=0.5s: Release GPIO 15
   - T=1s: Press GPIO 16 (BOW_STARBOARD)
   - T=1.5s: Release GPIO 16
   - T=2s: Rapid toggle GPIO 15 & 16 (test mutual exclusion)
   - T=3s: Stop

**Expected on analyzer**:
```
T=0s:     CH7 (GPIO 15) LOW, CH3 (BOW_PORT relay) LOW (< 50ms)
T=0.5s:   CH7 HIGH, CH3 HIGH
T=1s:     CH8 (GPIO 16) LOW, CH4 (BOW_STARBOARD relay) LOW
T=1.5s:   CH8 HIGH, CH4 HIGH
T=2.0-2.3s: Rapid toggles on CH7/CH8
           → Ch3/4 should NEVER BOTH be LOW (mutual exclusion enforced)
           → Transitions smooth, no intermediate glitches
```

**Analysis** (check for):
- ✅ Port and starboard relays never both active
- ✅ < 100ms response to button press/release
- ✅ Direction transitions are clean (no intermediate float state)

---

### Phase D: Cross-System Interference (All 11 channels)
**Objective**: Verify anchor and bow systems don't interfere

1. **Start capture**
2. **Sequence**:
   - T=0s: Activate anchor UP (GPIO 12)
   - T=1s: While anchor running, activate bow PORT (GPIO 15)
   - T=2s: Release bow button (GPIO 15)
   - T=3s: Release anchor button (GPIO 12)
   - T=4s: Stop capture

**Expected** (all channels):
- Anchor relays (CH0-1) stay consistent while bow operates (CH3-4)
- Pulse counting (CH9-10) unaffected by bow motor
- No crosstalk between subsystems

---

**Export & Analysis** (Post-Capture):
1. Export capture as CSV from Saleae

   Time(s) | GPIO27 | GPIO14 | GPIO4 | GPIO5 | Button | Pulse | Direction
   0.00    | 1      | 1      | 1     | 1     | 0      | 0     | 1
   2.05    | 0      | 1      | 1     | 1     | 1      | 1     | 1
   ...
   ```
4. Measure latencies:
   - Button press to motor output (goal: < 100ms)

## 6. Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Device boots but motor won't respond to commands

**Possible Causes**:
1. Relay module not powered (check external 12V supply)
2. Motor GPIO pins damaged (test with multimeter)
3. Remote control override active (press release to deactivate)
4. Emergency stop active (send clear command)
5. Home sensor triggering falsely (check wiring)

**Debug Steps**:
```cpp
// Check logs for errors
Serial.println("Debug: Checking motor relay state");
digitalWrite(WINCH_UP, LOW);   // Force relay on
delay(100);
// Use multimeter to verify relay activation
```

### Issue: Pulse count wrong or stuck

**Possible Causes**:
1. PULSE_INPUT pin floating or damaged
2. Direction pin stuck
3. ISR not firing
4. Pull-up resistors weak

**Debug Steps**:
```cpp
// Monitor pulse ISR in logs
debugD("Pulse ISR firing: count=%d", pulse_count);
// Check pin states with logic analyzer
```

### Issue: SignalK won't connect

**Possible Causes**:
1. WiFi not connected (check logs for WiFi status)
2. SignalK server IP/port wrong
3. Device on wrong network
4. Firewall blocking connection

**Debug Steps**:
```
In logs, should see:
  - "WiFi connected: IP 192.168.x.x"
  - "Connecting to SignalK: 192.168.x.x:3000"
  - "SignalK connected"
```
